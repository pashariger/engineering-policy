# Engineering Self-Assessment
Ask yourself these questions to see how well you're dealing with the fundamentals of running an engineering team. For maximum effect, ask "what are we doing about this?" as well as "why are we doing it this way?"

## I.  Company
1. Have we clearly articulated and written down our company vision and mission (and shared them with the team)?
2. Can everyone on the team explain what the organization vision, mission and current goals are? Are the answers consistent?

## II. Development Methodology 
### Roles & Responsibilities 
1. Who is responsible for writing user stories/requirements and prioritizing work?
2. What are individual contributors responsible for? What are they held accountable for?
3. Who is responsible for making sure that engineering discipline and policies are upheld and trains the engineering team in that regard?
4. Are there any individuals outside of engineering who should be involved in the product development process? How are they looped in?
5. Do we have a technical advisor/mentor?

### Tools & Tangibles 
1. How do we keep track of work that needs to get done in the future?
2. How do we keep track of tasks that are currently being worked on?
3. Where does one look to educate themselves on company policy, practices, and technical and product initiatives?

### Organization 
1. What practices are in place to keep the team communicating about in-progress work and staying in sync?
2. How do make sure that our product roadmap and planned work stays up-to-date?
3. How does work get estimated and assigned to the team to implement?
4. How do we evaluate whether we are meeting our expectations with delivery?
5. How do we make sure that we reflect on and improve our engineering practices as a team?
6. How do we make system-wide architectural decisions and reflect on those decisions?
7. What do we do to make sure that engineering management has a vision for the organization and makes and measures progress toward that vision?
8. How do we make sure that management builds strong, trusting relationships with their employees? How do we get feedback from employees, spot and prevent conflicts, and help them grow professionally?
9. Have we identified the biggest knowledge and experience gaps in our engineering organization? Have we attracted and properly utilized advisors to fill those gaps?

## III. Engineering Philosophy & Practices 
### Principles 
1. What are the guiding principles of our engineering organization?
2. What is the definition of “done” in the context of our development workflow?
3. Can we clearly describe, defend and be proud of our architecture?

### Version Control & Workflow 
1. How is version control handled?
2. What is the branching strategy?
3. How do we train our engineers in using the agreed-upon workflow?

### Testing 
1. Do we write tests? To what extent? How did we arrive at this?
2. Are we doing TDD? Why or why not?

### Coding Standards 
1. How do we know how well we are doing with testing? How do we encourage or enforce good testing practices?
2. How do we maintain code styling consistency across our projects?
3. Are there any specific coding patterns that we expect our team to follow?
4. Do we do peer code review? Why or why not?

### DevOps
1. How do we integrate work from multiple developers and branches and ensure that it is safe to deploy to production?
2. What environments exist for testing and CI, and how are they accessible to engineers?
3. How do deployments happen?
4. What DevOps KPIs do we keep track off? Do we have goals that we are marching toward given this data?

### Incident Management 
1. What is the procedure for reacting to incidents/downtime?
2. How do we learn from incidents that occur?

### Monitoring
1. How do we track our service uptime?
2. How are we notified if an error occurs?

Security
1. What are the security policies our organization follows?
2. Who has access to the production environment?
3. Do we have a bug-bounty program?

## IV. Onboarding 
1. What accounts does a new hire need access to?
2. Where can they find and read some on-boarding documentation?
3. How does a developer set up their local environment?
4. How is the engineer walked through their first deployment?
5. Do we have an off-boarding procedure or checklist that protects company communications, access to information, and morale?

## V. Hiring
1. What is our lead generation process? Are we measuring the ROI on different methods and adjusting accordingly, or spraying and praying?
2. Have we thought through our interview process & pipeline? Do we have the right experience to vet candidates? If not, how do we compensate for this? Do we follow up on references?
3. Do we have clearly defined criteria for grading candidates on "Must haves", "Nice to haves", and "Important" characteristic? Are our interviewers in sync on those criteria?
4. Once a hire is made, do we have a trial period? How long is it? Are expectations clearly communicated and performance measured?
